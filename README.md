### Hey there, I'm Jake ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Cyber Security Professional, specialising in the field of OT Cyber Security
This Github will primarily consist of my own personal projects, and writeups of CTF's. I also have a personal website, for more long-form educational style blog posts covering relevant topics. My reasoning behind these writeups/blog posts is to reinforce my own understanding of these topics and to allow for documentation of my skillset.
